## 📁 Dataset Description

The images in this repository are used for evaluating and demonstrating the capabilities of our **WorldCrafter** framework for dynamic scene generation from a single image and text prompt.

- The dataset consists of a small set of example images.
- Each image serves as an input for camera-motion-conditioned video generation.
- The data supports evaluation in multiple camera settings (pan, zoom, etc).
